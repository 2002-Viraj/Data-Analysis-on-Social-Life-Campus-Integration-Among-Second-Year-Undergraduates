## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes **social engagement and campus integration** among second-year undergraduates in the **Faculty of Science**.  
It was completed as part of the **IS 3005 – Data Analysis** module.

The study focuses on how **extracurricular activities, event participation, and demographic factors** influence students’ sense of belonging and engagement within the university.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Describe the demographic and background characteristics of second-year undergraduates  
- Measure the level of campus integration among students  
- Assess the relationship between extracurricular participation and campus integration  
- Identify whether demographic and personal factors are associated with campus integration levels

## 🗂 Dataset & Methodology
- **Target Population:** Second-year undergraduates (Faculty of Science)  
- **Sampling Method:** Convenience sampling  
- **Sample Size:** ~60 students  
- **Data Collection:** Online questionnaire  

### Variables Used
- Gender  
- Residence type  
- Monthly allowance  
- Number of clubs/societies  
- Sports participation  
- Event participation frequency  
- Likert-scale responses for campus integration

## 📐 Campus Integration Score
A composite **Campus Integration Score** was created using **7 Likert-scale questions (1–5)** measuring:
- Sense of belonging  
- Peer interaction  
- Group participation  
- Peer and academic support  
- Friendships  
- Inclusion in university life  

Reliability was tested using **Cronbach’s Alpha**.
